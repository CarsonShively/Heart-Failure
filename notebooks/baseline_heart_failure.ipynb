Therefore, recall is the key metric.\n","\n","What I learned from the baseline model:\n","1. The model is generalizing well. It performed well on the hold-out test set, because the dataset is relatively small, I tested the recall on 5 additional random seeds to ensure it wasn't a lucky split and the results held.\n","2. The false negative rate is currently around 42.1% on the hold-out set (8 false negatives out of 19 actual positives), which is relatively high and should be further reduced in the final model to avoid missing high-risk patients.\n","3. The model significantly prioritized numeric features over binary ones. Among all features, time was the most significant factor, based on SHAP values."],"metadata":{"id":"9z_BXXT0gBXM"}}]}
